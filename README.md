# Weather App (JavaScript) 
- Developed a weather application that dynamically displays current weather data based on the user's location.
- Implemented using the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch real-time weather information.
- Utilized the HTML Geolocation API to request user location access.
- After the user allows location access, the app will display the temperature, weather description and icon, and 
location name.
